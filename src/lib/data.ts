// This file is being removed as all dynamic data will now be fetched from the API.
// Static data like categories and services will be moved to a new `constants.ts` file.
// All functions like getProviders, saveProviders, etc., are now obsolete.
// This file is intentionally left empty to signify its removal.
// A new file `src/lib/constants.ts` will be created.
