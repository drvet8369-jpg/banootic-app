This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with Firebase Studio, showcasing a local services marketplace for women artisans. It uses Supabase for authentication and database management.

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have set up your Supabase project and configured the necessary environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase project's anonymous public key.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase project's service role key (for admin tasks).
- `KAVENEGAR_API_KEY`: Your Kavenegar API key for sending OTPs.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
