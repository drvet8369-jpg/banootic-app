## Important Supabase Note

Some advanced settings in the Supabase dashboard, such as the **Database Reset** option and the **Database Connection String (URI)**, are only visible on the desktop version of the website. If you are using a mobile device, you may need to switch your browser to "Desktop site" view to access these settings.
